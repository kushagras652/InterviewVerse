Interview should include : 

1 . These will be clubbed inside the post route() - First instantiatte the model,then pass these user inputs(wrapped inside object) to the this model
Then use the save method
USER INPUTS : 
Date
Topic
Questions asked
Mistakes made by made
Soluttion of these mistakes

2. Get all Routes 

Authentication system aint that userFul here,coz we dont need to see other users
The Backend will be Basic,i will focus here more on the UI,its logic(which aint that tough for me)


GREAT IDEA : WE CAN USE OPENaI API TO GET SOLUTION OF THE MISTAKES,use Chat Gpt for it

GREAT IDEA 2 : WE CAN MAKE A PROPER SOCIAL INTERVIEW EXP SHARING WEBSITE,WHERE OTHERS CAN LEARN FROM EACH OTHERS INTERVIEW EXPERIENCE,(WE CAN MAKE LOGIC FOR SEARCHING BY TYPINH THE TOPIC)
